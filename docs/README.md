## What is Fog Of War?
In origin, Fog of War is a term coined and initially used by military officers. Fog of War refers to the uncertainty from difficulty of accurate recognition of your adversaries capabilities, terrain layout and your capabilities to react to the problems that may arise due to this uncertainty.

So in essence, Fog of War is the lack of accurate information regarding a strategic factor you can’t control. 

Since uncertainty can be a very powerful mechanic of a game, specially in strategy games we will now see how the concept of Fog of War is applied to video games both in terms of design and implementation.
